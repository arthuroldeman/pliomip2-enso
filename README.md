# pliomip2-enso
Analysis codes used the PlioMIP2 ENSO data analysis in Oldeman et al. (2021, in prep.)
Link to preprint: https://cp.copernicus.org/preprints/cp-2021-58/

These codes have been used to create the data presented in the figures and tables of the manuscript mentioned above (+ the supplementary material). 

100 years SST data (anomalies as well as monthly means) of all PlioMIP2 ensemble members are available through Alan Haywood (a.m.haywood@leeds.ac.uk). Links to observational data (both HadISST and Pliocene reconstructions) are presented in the manuscript as well as the codes. I will provide a clearer overview on this page at a later stage.

*Note: I will clean up the codes soon.*
